    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Matt. I have worked in and been a part of the arts for most of
      life. While doing so, I have worked numerous jobs in numerous fields, from
      many types of customer service to children's education to freelance
      videography. In my latter years, I hope to continue my work in the
      arts while also practicing web development as a career, something that
      appeals to me on both scientific and artistic levels.
